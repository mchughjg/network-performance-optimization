Network Traffic Datset

Description

This project aims to optimize network performance by analyzing network traffic data to identify performance bottlenecks and develop strategies for network enhancement. 
Utilizing tools like Wireshark for traffic analysis and Nagios for performance monitoring, the project focuses on improving network efficiency and user experience. 

Possible Research Questions

What is the distribution of traffic across different protocols in the network?
How does network latency vary across different times of the day?
Can network performance issues be predicted based on specific traffic patterns or device attributes?
